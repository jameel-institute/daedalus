There are 45 economic sectors, given by \code{N_ECON_SECTORS}, with the first
'sector' representing non-working individuals. All age groups that are
considered non-working are in this first sector (children and retirees),
while working-age individuals may be distributed flexibly into the various
economic sectors (including non-working).
