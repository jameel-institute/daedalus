\code{COMPARTMENTS} returns a character vector of the epidemiological
compartment names. \code{idx_COMPARTMENTS} returns a list with the compartment
index.

All other constants return integer values.
}
\description{
Names and indices for the epidemiological compartments used in
DAEDALUS, for reuse in model code. The duplication is for ease of extracting
indices from a named list, and of extracting names without having to call
\code{names()}.
}
\details{
DAEDALUS has 7 epidemiological compartments: susceptible, exposed, infectious
and symptomatic ("infect_symp"), infectious and asymptomatic ("infect_asymp")
, hospitalised, recovered, and dead.

There are 2 additional compartments that track the number of new infections
and new hospitalisations.
