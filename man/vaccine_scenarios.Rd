\title{Vaccine investment scenario parameters}
\format{
\subsection{\code{vaccination_scenario_data}}{

A list with 4 elements, each corresponding to an advance vaccine investment
strategy. Each element is a list of three values (see \strong{Details}).
\itemize{
\item \code{vax_start_time}: A single number for the vaccination start time in days.
\item \code{nu}: A single number for the daily vaccination rate as a percentage
of the population vaccinated.
\item \code{vax_uptake_limit}: A single number for the percentage of the population
that is willing to be vaccinated.
}
}

\subsection{\code{vaccination_scenario_names}}{

A character vector of four elements giving the identifier for each scenario.
}

\subsection{\code{vaccination_parameter_names}}{

A character vector of three elements giving the identifier for vaccination
parameters.
}

An object of class \code{character} of length 4.

An object of class \code{character} of length 5.

\description{
Vaccination parameters for four main pre-pandemic scenarios of
pre-pandemic investments in vaccine development and delivery.

\code{vaccination_scenario_names} provides the names by which the advance vaccine
investment scenarios are known.
}
\details{
Each scenario has three parameters; parameters do not differ across age or
other groups.
\itemize{
\item Vaccination start time: The time in days at which vaccination begins.
\item Vaccination rate: The rate, as a percentage of the population vaccinated
per day.
\item Vaccination uptake limit: The percentage of the population that is willing
to accept vaccination.
