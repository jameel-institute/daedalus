  {"id":"haw2022","abstract":"To study the trade-off between economic, social and health outcomes in the management of a pandemic, DAEDALUS integrates a dynamic epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with a multi-sector economic model, reflecting sectoral heterogeneity in transmission and complex supply chains. The model identifies mitigation strategies that optimize economic production while constraining infections so that hospital capacity is not exceeded but allowing essential services, including much of the education sector, to remain active. The model differentiates closures by economic sector, keeping those sectors open that contribute little to transmission but much to economic output and those that produce essential services as intermediate or final consumption products. In an illustrative application to 63 sectors in the United Kingdom, the model achieves an economic gain of between £161 billion (24%) and £193 billion (29%) compared to a blanket lockdown of non-essential activities over six months. Although it has been designed for SARS-CoV-2, DAEDALUS is sufficiently flexible to be applicable to pandemics with different epidemiological characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Haw","given":"David J."},{"family":"Forchini","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Doohan","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Christen","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Pianella","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Bajaj","given":"Sumali"},{"family":"Hogan","given":"Alexandra B."},{"family":"Winskill","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Miraldo","given":"Marisa"},{"family":"White","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Ghani","given":"Azra C."},{"family":"Ferguson","given":"Neil M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Hauck","given":"Katharina D."}],"citation-key":"haw2022","container-title":"Nature Computational Science","container-title-short":"Nat Comput Sci","DOI":"10.1038/s43588-022-00233-0","ISSN":"2662-8457","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","page":"223-233","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Optimizing social and economic activity while containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission using DAEDALUS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00233-0","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"jarvis2024","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes in behaviour. To estimate if these persisted, a final round of the CoMix social contact survey was conducted in four countries at a time when all societal restrictions had been lifted for several months. We conducted a survey on a nationally representative sample in the UK, Netherlands (NL), Belgium (BE), and Switzerland (CH). Participants were asked about their contacts and behaviours on the previous day. We calculated contact matrices and compared the contact levels to a pre-pandemic baseline to estimate R0. Data collection occurred from 17 November to 7 December 2022. 7477 participants were recruited. Some were asked to undertake the survey on behalf of their children. Only 14.4 % of all participants reported wearing a facemask on the previous day. Self-reported vaccination rates in adults were similar for each country at around 86 %. Trimmed mean recorded contacts were highest in NL with 9.9 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 9.0–10.8) contacts per person per day and lowest in CH at 6.0 (95 % CI 5.4–6.6). Contacts at work were lowest in the UK (1.4 contacts per person per day) and highest in NL at 2.8 contacts per person per day. Other contacts were also lower in the UK at 1.6 per person per day (95 % CI 1.4–1.9) and highest in NL at 3.4 recorded per person per day (95 % CI 43.0–4.0). The next-generation approach suggests that R0 for a close-contact disease would be roughly half pre-pandemic levels in the UK, 80 % in NL and intermediate in the other two countries. The pandemic appears to have resulted in lasting changes in contact patterns expected to have an impact on the epidemiology of many different pathogens. Further post-pandemic surveys are necessary to confirm this finding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Christopher I."},{"family":"Coletti","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Backer","given":"Jantien A."},{"family":"Munday","given":"James D."},{"family":"Faes","given":"Christel"},{"family":"Beutels","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Althaus","given":"Christian L."},{"family":"Low","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Wallinga","given":"Jacco"},{"family":"Hens","given":"Niel"},{"family":"Edmunds","given":"W.

  {"id":"robinson2019","abstract":"Benefit-cost analysis and other forms of economic evaluation are powerful tools, encouraging the systematic collection and assessment of the evidence needed to support sound policy decisions. In low-and middle-income countries, where resources are very scarce and needs are very great, such decisions are particularly difficult and economic evaluation can be especially useful. If not well conducted and clearly reported, however, these studies can lead to erroneous conclusions. Differences in analytic methods and assumptions can also obscure important differences in policy impacts.Recognizing these challenges, a team of experts developed reference case guidelines to increase the comparability of benefit-cost analyses, improve their quality, and expand their use. The development process involved extensive participation from stakeholders as well as experts, including both practitioners and consumers, incorporating a variety of perspectives. The resulting guidelines provide an overview of the analytic framework, including its conceptual underpinnings and its implementation. They also provide specific recommendations in seven areas: (a) comparing values across countries and over time; (2) valuing mortality risk reductions; (3) valuing nonfatal health risk reductions; (4) valuing changes in time use; (5) assessing the distribution of impacts; (6) accounting for uncertainty and nonquantifiable impacts; and (7) summarizing and presenting the results. The goal is to support the conduct of high-quality analyses that promote understanding of difficult trade-offs and support evidence-based decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"Lisa A."},{"family":"Hammitt","given":"James K."},{"family":"Cecchini","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Chalkidou","given":"Kalipso"},{"family":"Claxton","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Cropper","given":"Maureen"},{"family":"Eozenou","given":"Patrick Hoang-Vu"},{"family":"Ferranti","given":"David","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Deolalikar","given":"Anil B."},{"family":"Campos Guanais de Aguiar","given":"Frederico"},{"family":"Jamison","given":"Dean T."},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Soonman"},{"family":"Lauer","given":"Jeremy Addison"},{"family":"O'Keeffe","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Damian"},{"family":"Whittington","given":"Dale"},{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"David"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Brad"}],"citation-key":"robinson2019","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.4015886","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,1]]},"language":"en","number":"4015886","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Reference Case Guidelines for Benefit-Cost Analysis in Global Health and Development","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4015886"},
  {"id":"walker2020","abstract":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a severe threat to public health worldwide. We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being, and economies of these countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Patrick G.

  {"id":"johnson_indonesia","abstract": "Objectives\nTo estimate the expected socio-economic value of booster vaccination in terms of averted deaths and averted closures of businesses and schools using simulation modelling.\n\nMethods\nThe value of booster vaccination in Indonesia is estimated by comparing simulated societal costs under a twelve-month, 187-million–dose Moderna booster vaccination campaign to costs without boosters. The costs of an epidemic and its mitigation consist of lost lives, economic closures and lost education; cost-minimising non-pharmaceutical mitigation is chosen for each scenario.\n\nResults\nThe cost-minimising non-pharmaceutical mitigation depends on the availability of vaccines: the differences between the two scenarios are 14 to 19 million years of in-person education and $153 to $204 billion in economic activity. The value of the booster campaign ranges from $2,500 ($1,400-$4,100) to $2,800 ($1,700-$4,600) per dose in the first year, depending on life-year valuations.\n\nConclusions\nThe societal benefits of booster vaccination are substantial. Much of the value of vaccination resides in the reduced need for costly non-pharmaceutical mitigation. We propose cost minimisation as a tool for policy decision-making and valuation of vaccination, taking into account all socio-economic costs, and not averted deaths alone.","type": "article-journal","container-title": "Vaccine","DOI": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2023.01.068","ISSN": "0264-410X","issue": "11","journalAbbreviation": "Vaccine","note": "PMID: 36781331\nPMCID: PMC9889258","page": "1885-1891","source": "PubMed Central","title": "The societal value of SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination in Indonesia","URL": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9889258/","volume": "41","author": [{"family": "Johnson","given": "Rob"},{"family": "Djaafara","given": "Bimandra"},{"family": "Haw","given": "David"},{"family": "Doohan","given": "Patrick"},{"family": "Forchini","given": "Giovanni"},{"family": "Pianella","given": "Matteo"},{"family": "Ferguson","given": "Neil"},{"family": "Smith","given": "Peter C."},{"family": "Hauck","given": "Katharina D."}],"accessed": {"date-parts": [["2025",5,28]]},"issued": {"date-parts": [["2023",3,10]]}},
