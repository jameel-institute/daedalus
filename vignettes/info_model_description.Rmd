## Model compartments and definitions:

Model compartments are stratified by age-economic sector $i$ and vaccination $j$ classes. After a susceptible individual $S$ becomes exposed to the virus they enter a latent state $E$, from which they can develop either a symptomatic $Is$ or asymptomatic $Ia$ infection. Whereas asymptomatically infected individuals are assumed to always recover, the latter can either recover $R$ or develop a more severe condition requiring hospitalisation $H$, from which they can either recover or die $D$.

- $S^{ij}(t)$ - Susceptible individuals not yet exposed to the pathogen

- $E^{ij}(t)$ - Exposed individuals (infected but not yet infectious)

- $Is^{ij}(t)$ - Symptomatic infectious individuals

- $Ia^{ij}(t)$ - Asymptomatic infectious individuals

- $H^{ij}(t)$ - Hospitalised individuals

- $R^{ij}(t)$ - Recovered individuals

- $D^{ij}(t)$ - Dead individuals

**Note that** the compartment transition rate parameters used in a call to `daedalus()` can be modified for a specific respiratory pathogen pandemic, either internally with calls to pre-defined pathogens, or with values considered to be more appropriate by the user.
