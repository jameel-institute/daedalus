This vignette presents a technical description of the _daedalus_ model in its current state. It should be noted _daedalus_ is in constant development; we will attempt to keep this document as updated as possible during the lifespan of the model. If you encounter any issues, contact the package developers or raise a GitHub issue.



# Rationale

The _daedalus_ package is the implementation of a deterministic epidemiological and economic model of the emergence and spread of respiratory pathogen pandemics in countries. Specifically, _daedalus_ tracks 

- Health impact in terms of infections, hospitalisations, deaths and years of life lost (YLL), and 

- Economic impact in terms of GDP losses from:
    - Economic sector closures and workforce depletion (i.e., as a result of self-isolation, infection, hospitalisation or death)
    - Present and life-time economic losses from missed education
    - Human life losses using the value of statistical life approach

Presently, we have equipped _daedalus_ with parameters to simulate nine potential pathogens (influenza A 2009, influenza A 1957, influenza A 1918, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 pre-Alpha variant, SARS-CoV-2 Delta and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, see \@ref(tab:pathogendata)) across 67 countries. In addition, _daedalus_ allows the user the flexibility to incorporate additional respiratory pathogen and/or country parameters and data, as considered appropriate for their use case.

The following sections present a technical description of the epidemiological and economic components of _daedalus_. For examples of its implementation in research case studies, see

# Epidemiological model

## Model structure

_daedalus_ simulates a country's population split into seven possible disease state compartments. Model compartments are stratified by age-economic sector $i$ and vaccination $j$ classes. 

A susceptible individual $S$ can become exposed to the virus and enter a latent state $E$, from which they can develop either a symptomatic $Is$ or asymptomatic $Ia$ infection. Whereas asymptomatic infected individuals are assumed to always recover, symptomatic ones can either recover $R$ or develop a more severe condition requiring hospitalisation $H$, from which they can either recover or die $D$.

### Ordinary differential equations

\begin{align}
    & \frac{dS_{i,j}}{dt} = \zeta_{i,j-1}(t) S_{i,j-1}(t) - \Lambda_{i,j} (t) S_{i,j}(t)  + \rho R_{i,j}(t)\\
    & \frac{dE_{i,j}}{dt} = \Lambda_{i,j} (t) S_{i,j}(t) - \sigma E_{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dIa_{i,j}}{dt} = (1 - p_{symp}) \sigma E_{i,j}(t) - \gamma_{Ia} Ia_{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dIs_{i,j}}{dt} = p_{symp} \sigma E_{i,j}(t) - \gamma_{Is} Is_{i,j}(t) - \eta^i Is_{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dH_{i,j}}{dt} = \eta^i Is_{i,j}(t) - \omega^i H_{i,j}(t) - \gamma_H^i H_{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dR_{i,j}}{dt} = \zeta_{i,j-1}(t) R_{i,j-1}(t) + \gamma_{Is} Is_{i,j}(t) + \gamma_{Ia} Ia_{i,j}(t) + \gamma_H^i H_{i,j}(t) - \rho R_{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dD_{i,j}}{dt} = \omega^i H_{i,j}(t)\\
\end{align}



::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Note that** the compartment transition rate parameters used in a call to `daedalus()` can be modified for a specific respiratory pathogen pandemic, either internally with calls to pre-defined pathogens, or with values considered to be more appropriate by the user.
:::


### Age-economic sector classes

There are 49 age-economic classes $i$ in _daedalus_: four age $i \in 1:4$ groups $( [0-5], [5-20), [20-65),65+)$ and, given population in $i=3$ (20-65) represents unemployed adults ofr working age, 45 economic groups $i \in 5:49$ (see in Economic model below).


### Vaccination classes

As a default, _daedalus_ further disaggregates the population into the vaccination classes $j \in 1:2$ of unvaccinated and vaccinated. We assume only the population in the susceptible and recovered compartments can be vaccinated, given transition rate $\zeta_{i,j=0}(t)$, which is determined by the user (see Table \@ref(tab:vaccine)). Vaccinated individuals can lose their immunity and transition back to an unvaccinated class, given rate $\rho$. 








## Model transition parameters

_daedalus_ can simulate nine different pathogens (influenza A 2009, influenza A 1957, influenza A 1918, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 pre-Alpha variant, SARS-CoV-2 Delta and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1) with pathogen-specific transition (see Table \@ref(tab:pathogendata)).

| **Parameter** | **Definition** |
| :----- | :----- |
| $\Lambda_{i,j} (t)$ | Force of infection by age-economic and vaccination class |
| $\sigma$ | Rate of progression from exposed to infectious |
| $p_{symp}$ | Proportion of exposed individuals becoming symptomatic |
| $\eta^i$ | Probability of hospitalisation by age|
| $\gamma_{Ia}$ | Recovery rate for asymptomatic infections |
| $\gamma_{Is}$ | Recovery rate for symptomatic infections |
| $\gamma_H^i$ | Recovery rate for hospitalised individuals by age |
| $\rho$ | Rate of waning immunity (recovered to susceptible) |
| $\omega^i$ | Death rate among hospitalised individuals (age/econ stratified) |
| $\zeta^i(t)$ | Vaccination rate |

Table: (\#tab:transitionpars) Definition of model transition parameters.



### Seed and force of infection

For any given pathogen, we assume a seed of 1 infection per-million population, of which 60\% are further assumed to be asymptomatic infections.

The force of infection $\lambda_{i,j} (t)$ accounts for the infection contributions of symptomatically $Is_{ij}(t)$ and asymptomatically $Ia_{ij}(t)$ infected individuals in the community and in workplaces.


We let $\delta Icomm^i(t)$ and $\delta Iwork^i(t)$ denote the number of infected individuals in the community and the workplace, respectively, weighted by their infectivity given
\begin{align}
    & \delta Icomm_{ij}(t) = \zeta_{i,j} (Ia_{i \in 1:4,j}(t) \epsilon + Is_{i \in 1:4,j}(t))\\
    & \delta Iwork_{ij}(t) = \zeta_{i,j} (Ia_{i \in 5:49,j}(t) \epsilon + Is_{i \in 5:49,j}(t)),
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ is the relative infectiousness of an asymptomatically infected individual relative to a symptomatic one, and $\zeta_{ij}$ the infectivity of an individual in strata $i,j$ relative to an unvaccinated individual of the same age.



The force of infection from the community $\lambda_{comm_{i,j}} (t)$ on a susceptible individual is thus modelled as 
\begin{align}
\lambda_{comm_{i,j}} (t) & =
    \beta (t) \cdot \chi_{i,j} \cdot \sum_{i'} m_{i,i'} \sum_{j'} \delta Icomm_{i',j'} (t)
\end{align}
where $\chi_{i,j}$ is the relative susceptibility to infection of a susceptible individual in strata $i,j$ relative to a non-vaccinated individual of the same strata, $\beta(t)$ represents a time-varying contact rate scaling factor, determined by social distancing interventions simulated, and $m_{i,i'}$ is the (symmetric) person-to-person contact rate between age group $i$ and $i'$.



The force of infection within the workplace $\lambda_{work_{i,j}} (t)$ is modelled as 
\begin{align}
\lambda_{work_{i,j}} (t) & =
    \beta (t) \cdot \chi_{i,j} \cdot \Phi(t) \cdot \sum_{i'} C_{i,i'} \sum_{j'} \delta Iwork_{i',j'} (t)
\end{align}
where $C_{i,i'}$ is a contact matrix specific to the workplace, and $\Phi(t)$ is a scaling factor determined by economic closure interventions simulated.


Lastly, the force of infection from infected individuals in the community to susceptible workers $\lambda_{c2w_{i,j}} (t)$ (i.e.~asymptomatically infected individuals from the community attending shops, etc.) is given by
\begin{align}
\lambda_{c2w_{i,j}} (t) & =
    \beta (t) \cdot \chi_{i,j} \cdot \Phi(t) \cdot \sum_{i'} CtoW_{i,i'} \sum_{j'} \delta Icomm_{i',j'} (t)
\end{align}
where $CtoW_{i,i'}$ is a contact matrix specific to consumers attending workplaces.



The total force of infection acting on susceptible individuals is then assumed to be an addition of the above
\begin{equation}
    \Lambda_{ij} (t) = \lambda_{comm_{ij}} (t) + \lambda_{work_{ij}} (t) + \lambda_{c2w_{i,j}} (t).
\end{equation}

Table: (\#tab:pathogendata) Pathogen parameters. A different pathogen profile can be created by the user by generating a list object specifying these parameter values (see list structure for these pathogens in `daedalus.data::infection_data`). *Note disease severity progression is modelled with competing rates (e.g., for individuals in the $Ia$ compartment, of recovery $\gamma_{Is}$ vs hospitalisation by age $\eta^i$); where NA values are specified, we assume these individuals cannot undergo the respective disease severity transition.


### Vaccination

Vaccination is implemented as a series of default pre-determined vaccine investment scenarios, which can be modified as necessary by the user. 

| **Advance vaccine investment** | **Start time (days)** | **Rate (\% per day)** | **Uptake limit (\%)** | **Efficacy* (\%)** | **Waning period (mean, days)** |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| None   | 365 | 0.14 | 40 | 50 | 270 |
| Low    | 300 | 0.29 | 50 | 50 | 270 |
| Medium | 200 | 0.43 | 60 | 50 | 270 |
| High   | 100 | 0.5  | 80 | 50 | 270 |

Table: (\#tab:vaccine) Vaccination parameters. These pre-specified parameters can be modified by the user and/or additional strategies can be added by generating a list object with the same structure (see `daedalus.data::vaccination_scenario_data`). *Note the default version of _daedalus_ only models vaccine efficacy against infection; for use cases with added functionality to simulate efficacy against other clinical severity end-points see @johnson_indonesia.





# Economic model

_daedalus_ assigns monetary values to the years of life lost (YLL) $K_1$, economic activity losses $K_2$ and years of education lost $K_3$. The following sections describe the methodology for calculating each of these losses. The total socioeconomic loss (TSL) of a respiratory pandemic is therefore given by
```math
TSL = K_1 + K_2 + K_3.
```

## Years of life lost

We estimate the number of years of life lost by age and country using life tables from the @gbd_life. Formally, we used the life expectancy by age and country $\hat{L}_i$ to estimate life years lost for deceased individuals given

\begin{equation}
YLL^i = \int_{t=0}^t \sum_{j} D_{i,j}(t)dt \cdot \hat{L}_i.
\end{equation}

We then use the VSL approach to estimate the monetary value of lives lost. The VSL reflects individuals' willingness to trade wealth for a reduction in mortality risk (@cutler2020). Following standardised methods (@hammitt2020;@ananthapavan2021;@robinson2021), we assume the VSL of the USA and adjust for differences in income elasticity by country, which are further assumed to be higher in lower-income settings because the opportunity cost of spending on basic necessities becomes large if incomes are at or below subsistence (@hammitt2020). 

Formally, for country $a$ we estimate its VSL by age $VSL_a^i$ as a function of GDP given

\begin{equation}
VSL_a^i = VSL_{USA}^i \left(r_a \frac{GDP^a}{GDP_{USA}}  \right)^{r_e}
\end{equation}

where $r_a$ is the country's conversion rate of its market exchange rate GDP to a purchasing power parity GDP, and $r_e$ its income elasticity, which we estimated from OECD data as in @robinson2021.

The monetary value of years of life lost $K_1$ is then 

\begin{equation}
K_1 = \sum_i YLL^i \cdot VSL_a^i.
\end{equation}



## Economic activity losses

We calculate the cost of economic closures by each of 45 $k$ sectors in terms of lost gross value added (GVA). _daedalus_ runs in continuous time, with outputs calculated at daily time steps. 

The daily GDP generated by a country in the absence of closures is composed of the maximum daily GVA $y_k(t)$ for each sector $k$. There is a 1:1 mapping of the 45 economic sectors and the age-economic population strata $i \in 5:49$. For conciseness, in this section we index economic sectors and age-economic classes only as $k$.

Formally, the maximum possible GDP generated $Y_0(t)$ by all economic sectors $m_S$ in the absence of mandated closures (i.e., as a result of NPIs) at time $t$ is defined by

\begin{equation}
Y_0(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{m_S}y_k(t),
\end{equation}

where all economic sectors contribute their daily GVA $y_k(t)$. 

If an economic sector is, however, affected by closures on a given day, we estimate its GVA losses as

\begin{equation}
y_k(t) = y_k(0) \cdot (1 - \kappa_k(t))
\end{equation}

where $y_k(0)$ is the respective sector's daily GVA in the absence of closure and $\kappa_k(t)$ its relative openness (i.e., from 0 to 1, where 0 is completely open and 1 completely closed). We thus assume sectors contribute \$0 USD in GVA on day $t$ if completely closed.


In addition to GVA losses from closures, economic sectors can lose productivity whilst being open given depletion of their workforce (i.e., due to self-isolation, sickness, hospitalisation or death). $x_{k}(t)$ is the proportion of the workforce contributing to economic production in sector $k$ out of the total workforce $N_k$ on day $t$. As the workforce of a sector is depleted, we assume a smaller fraction $\hat{x}_{j}(t)$ will be available to contribute to production given

\begin{equation}
\hat{x}_{k}(t) = x_{k}(t) \left(1 - \sum_{j=0}^{1} \left( \frac{Ia^{j,k}(t) + Is^{j,k}(t) + H^{j,k}(t) + D^{j,k}(t)}{N_k} \right) \right).
\end{equation}

The total GDP generated at time $t$ is then

\begin{equation}
Y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{m_S} y_k(t) \hat{x}_{k}(t),
\end{equation}

and the GDP loss compared to the maximum is 

\begin{equation}
K_2 = \int_{t=0}^t \left( Y_0(t) - Y(t) \right)dt.
\end{equation}



## Years of education lost

We monetise the value of a school day $VSD$ as a country-specific parameter, as previously done in @psacharopoulos2021, given by

\begin{equation}
VSD = \frac{VPE \cdot MAE \cdot RYE}{365}
\end{equation}

where $MAE$ is the mean annual earnings (estimated using GDP multiplied by labour share of income, as in @feenstra2015), $RYE$ the rate of return for one year of education, assumed fixed at 0.08, and $VPE$ is the yearly present value of lost earnings given by

**TODO**: Rob, I cannot find any reference in the _daedalus_ code or data of how this was calculated. Is it that the country data files were prepared and saved following the equation for $p^{12}$ in your technical appendix? If you could please corroborate and re-write the correct form of that equation here it will be ace. Thanks!

Thus, in addition to GVA losses from closures, as done for all economic sectors (see section above), we estimate total education sector losses as

\begin{equation}
K_3 = \int_{t=0}^t \left( y_{edu}(t) + N_{i=2}(t) \cdot VSD \cdot (1 - \kappa_{edu}(t)) \cdot (1 - \pi) \right)dt
\end{equation}

where $N_{i=2}(t)$ is the number of pupils available at time $t$ (i.e., population of school-age not infected, hospitalised or deceased), $\pi$ a fixed parameter of the effectiveness of remote education.
