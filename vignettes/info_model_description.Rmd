This vignette presents a technical description of the _daedalus_ model in its current state. It should be noted _daedalus_ is in constant development; we will attempt to keep this document as updates as possible during the lifespan of the model. If you encounter any issues, contact the package developers or raise a GitHub issue.



# Rationale

The _daedalus_ package is the implementation of a deterministic epidemiological and economic model of the emergence and spread of respiratory pathogen pandemics in synthetic countries. Specifically, _daedalus_ tracks 

- Health impact in terms of infections, hospitalisations, deaths and years of life lost (YLL), and 

- Economic impact in terms of GDP lost from economic sector closures and workforce depletion (i.e., as a result of self-isolation, infection, hospitalisation or death). 

Presently, we have equipped _daedalus_ with parameters to simulate nine potential pathogens (influenza A 2009, influenza A 1957, influenza A 1918, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 pre-Alpha variant, SARS-CoV-2 Delta and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, see \@ref(tab:pathogendata)) across 67 synthetic countries (see \@ref(tab:countrydata)). In addition, _daedalus_ allows the user the flexibility to incorporate additional respiratory pathogen and/or country parameters and data, as considered appropriate for their use case.

The following sections present a technical description of the epidemiological and economic components of _daedalus_, its parameters and input data. For examples of its implementation in research case studies, see

# Epidemiological model

## Model structure

_daedalus_ simulates an entire synthetic country's population split into seven possible disease state compartments. Model compartments are stratified by age-economic sector $i$ and vaccination $j$ classes. 

A susceptible individual $S$ can become exposed to the virus and enter a latent state $E$, from which they can develop either a symptomatic $Is$ or asymptomatic $Ia$ infection. Whereas asymptomatic infected individuals are assumed to always recover, symptomatic ones can either recover $R$ or develop a more severe condition requiring hospitalisation $H$, from which they can either recover or die $D$.

### Ordinary differential equations

\begin{align}
    & \frac{dS^{i,j}}{dt} = \zeta^{i,j-1}(t) S^{i,j-1}(t) - \Lambda^{i,j} (t) S^{i,j}(t)  + \rho R^{i,j}(t)\\
    & \frac{dE^{i,j}}{dt} = \Lambda^{i,j} (t) S^{i,j}(t) - \sigma E^{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dIa^{i,j}}{dt} = (1 - p_{symp}) \sigma E^{i,j}(t) - \gamma_{Ia} Ia^{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dIs^{i,j}}{dt} = p_{symp} \sigma E^{i,j}(t) - \gamma_{Is} Is^{i,j}(t) - \eta^i Is^{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dH^{i,j}}{dt} = \eta^i Is^{i,j}(t) - \omega^i H^{i,j}(t) - \gamma_H^i H^{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dR^{i,j}}{dt} = \zeta^{i,j-1}(t) R^{i,j-1}(t) + \gamma_{Is} Is^{i,j}(t) + \gamma_{Ia} Ia^{i,j}(t) + \gamma_H^i H^{i,j}(t) - \rho R^{i,j}(t) \\
    & \frac{dD^{i,j}}{dt} = \omega^i H^{i,j}(t)\\
\end{align}

**Note that** the compartment transition rate parameters used in a call to `daedalus()` can be modified for a specific respiratory pathogen pandemic, either internally with calls to pre-defined pathogens, or with values considered to be more appropriate by the user.

### Age-economic sector classes

There are 49 age-economic classes $i$ in _daedalus_. Age-economic classes $i \in 1:4$ represent the population disaggregated into four age groups $( [0-5], [5-20), [20-65),65+)$. Population in $i=3$ (20-65), however, includes only those that are not in employment (not economically active). The remainder are disaggregated in groups $i \in 5:49$, individuals of working age employed across 45 economic sectors (see in Economic model below).


### Vaccination classes

As a default, _daedalus_ further disaggregates the population into the vaccination classes $j \in 1:3$ of unvaccinated, fully vaccinated and waned immunity from vaccination. The parameters of full and waned vaccine efficacy, however, can be manipulated by the user with values considered more appropriate for their use case (e.g., vaccinated with doses one and two of a two course vaccine).





## Model transition parameters

_daedalus_ can simulate nine different pathogens (influenza A 2009, influenza A 1957, influenza A 1918, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 pre-Alpha variant, SARS-CoV-2 Delta and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1) with pathogen-specific transition (see \@ref(tab:pathogendata)).

| **Parameter** | **Definition** |
| :----- | :----- |
| $\Lambda^{i,j} (t)$ | Force of infection by age-economic and vaccination class |
| $\sigma$ | Rate of progression from exposed to infectious |
| $p_{symp}$ | Proportion of exposed individuals becoming symptomatic |
| $\eta^i$ | Probability of hospitalisation by age|
| $\gamma_{Ia}$ | Recovery rate for asymptomatic infections |
| $\gamma_{Is}$ | Recovery rate for symptomatic infections |
| $\gamma_H^i$ | Recovery rate for hospitalised individuals by age |
| $\rho$ | Rate of waning immunity (recovered to susceptible) |
| $\omega^i$ | Death rate among hospitalised individuals (age/econ stratified) |
| $\zeta^i(t)$ | Vaccination rate |

Table: (\#tab:transitionpars) Definition of model transition parameters.



### Seed and force of infection

For any given pathogen, we assume a seed of 1 infection per-million population, of which 60\% are further assumed to be asymptomatic infections.

The force of infection $\lambda^{i,j} (t)$ accounts for the infection contributions of symptomatically $Is^{ij}(t)$ and asymptomatically $Ia^{ij}(t)$ infected individuals in the community and in workplaces.


We let $\delta I_{comm}^i(t)$ and $\delta I_{work}^i(t)$ denote the number of infected individuals in the community and the workplace, respectively, weighted by their infectivity given
\begin{align}
    & \delta I_{comm}^{ij}(t) = \zeta^{i,j} (Ia^{i \in 1:4,j}(t) \epsilon + Is^{i \in 1:4,j}(t))\\
    & \delta I_{work}^{ij}(t) = \zeta^{i,j} (Ia^{i \in 5:49,j}(t) \epsilon + Is^{i \in 5:49,j}(t)),
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ is the relative infectiousness of an asymptomatically infected individual relative to a symptomatic one, and $\zeta^{ij}$ the infectivity of an individual in strata $i,j$ relative to an unvaccinated individual of the same age accounting for vaccine efficacy against onward transmission $e^{ij}_{inf}$. 



The force of infection from the community $\lambda^{i,j}_{comm} (t)$ on a susceptible individual is thus modelled as 
\begin{align}
\lambda^{i,j}_{comm} (t) & =
    \beta (t) \cdot \chi^{i,j} \cdot \sum_{i'} m_{i,i'} \sum_{j'} \delta I_{comm}^{i',j'} (t)
\end{align}
where $\chi^{i,j}$ is the relative susceptibility to infection of a susceptible individual in strata $i,j$ relative to a non-vaccinated individual of the same strata, $\beta(t)$ represents a time-varying contact rate scaling factor, determined by social distancing interventions simulated, and $m_{i,i'}$ is the (symmetric) person-to-person contact rate between age group $i$ and $i'$.



The force of infection within the workplace $\lambda^{i,j}_{work} (t)$ is modelled as 
\begin{align}
\lambda^{i,j}_{work} (t) & =
    \beta (t) \cdot \chi^{i,j} \cdot \Phi(t) \cdot \sum_{i'} C_{i,i'} \sum_{j'} \delta I_{work}^{i',j'} (t)
\end{align}
where $C_{i,i'}$ is a contact matrix specific to the workplace, and $\Phi(t)$ is a scaling factor determined by economic closure interventions simulated.


Lastly, the force of infection from infected individuals in the community to susceptible workers $\lambda^{i,j}_{c2w} (t)$ (i.e.~asymptomatically infected individuals from the community attending shops, etc.) is given by
\begin{align}
\lambda^{i,j}_{c2w} (t) & =
    \beta (t) \cdot \chi^{i,j} \cdot \Phi(t) \cdot \sum_{i'} CtoW_{i,i'} \sum_{j'} \delta I_{comm}^{i',j'} (t)
\end{align}
where $CtoW_{i,i'}$ is a contact matrix specific to consumers attending workplaces.



The total force of infection acting on susceptible individuals is then assumed to be an addition of the above
\begin{equation}
    \Lambda^{ij} (t) = \lambda_{comm}^{ij} (t) + \lambda_{work}^{ij} (t) + \lambda^{i,j}_{c2w} (t).
\end{equation}

Table: (\#tab:pathogendata) Pathogen parameters and data sources. A different pathogen profile can be created by the user by generating a list object specifying these parameter values (see list structure for these pathogens in `daedalus.data::infection_data`). *Note disease severity progression is modelled with competing rates (e.g., for individuals in the $Ia$ compartment, of recovery $\gamma_{Is}$ vs hospitalisation by age $\eta^i$); where NA values are specified, we assume these individuals cannot undergo the respective disease severity transition.


### Vaccination transition rates





# Economic model

_daedalus_ assigns monetary values to the years of life lost (YLL) $K_1$, years of education lost $K_2$ and economic activity losses $K_3$, given

\begin{align}
& K_1 = YLL * VLY,\\
& K_2 = \text{school years lost} * VSY,\\
& K_3 = GDP_{lost},
\end{align}

where $VLY$ is the value of a life year, $VSY$ the value of a school year and $GDP_{lost}$ is the total (summed across all economic sectors) of GDP lost over the closure period due to reduced economic activity of sectors.


The total socioeconomic loss (TSL) of a respiratory pandemic is therefore given by
```math
TSL = K_1 + K_2 + K3.
```

## Years of life lost


## Years of education lost


## Economic activity losses

We calculate the cost of economic closures by each of 45 $j$ sectors in terms of lost gross value added (GVA). The yearly GDP generated by a country in the absence of closures is composed of the maximum GVA $y_j$ for each sector $j$. 

Formally, the maximum possible GDP generated $Y_0$ by all economic sectors $m_S$ in the absence of mandated closures (i.e., as a result of NPIs) is defined by

\begin{equation}
Y_0=\frac{\tau}{365}\sum_{j=1}^{m_S}y_j,
\end{equation}

where all economic sectors contribute GVA according to the proportion of days in a year $\tau$ they are open for production. The only exception to this is the education sector, which we assume contributes its maximum possible GVA as $y_{\text{ed}}$. 


In addition of GVA losses from closures, economic sectors can lose productivity from depletion of their workforce (i.e., due to self-isolation, sickness, hospitalisation or death). $x_{j}(t)$ is the proportion of the workforce contributing to economic production in sector $j$ out of the total workforce $N_j$ on day $t$. As the workforce of a sector is depleted, we assume a smaller fraction ($`\hat{x}_{j}(t)`$) will be available to contribute to production.

\begin{equation}
\hat{x}_{j}(t)=x_{j}(t)\left(1 - \left(p_j^{23}(t)  + (1-q_j)p_j^{22}(t)\right)/N_j\right)
\end{equation}

where $q_j$ is the fraction of the sector working from home. $p_j^{23}(t)$ represents worker sickness and death:

\begin{equation}
p_j^{23}(t)=\sum_{v=0}^{m_V}\left(\left(1-p^H_{j,v}\right)p^1p^{19}I_{j,v}^{s}+p^H_{j,v}p^1I_{j,v}^{s}+H_{j,v}+D_{j,v}\right),
\end{equation}

with $m_V=2$ vaccines and $p_j^{22}(t)$ represents lost output from asymptomatic self-isolating workers:

\begin{equation}
p_j^{22}(t)=p^2(t)p^{18}I_{j}^{a}.
\end{equation}

$p^{18}$ is the number of days spent in self isolation per day of infectiousness (e.g. suppose the average infectious period is four days and mandatory self-isolation time is ten days, then $p^{19}=2.5$ and $p^{18}=p^{19}T^{I^s}/T^{I^a:R}$, where $T^{I^s}$ and $T^{I^a:R}$ are expected infectious periods for symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively). $p^1$ is compliance with the requirement to self isolate and $p^2(t)$ is the fraction of cases identified. Other notations are vaccine status $v$, infectious and asymptomatic $I_{j,v}^{a}$, infectious and symptomatic $I_{j,v}^{s}$, hospitalised $H$, deceased $D$, and probability to be hospitalised $p^H$. 

Then the total GDP is

\begin{equation}
Y =  \frac{1 }{365} \sum_{j\neq\text{ed}}^{m_S}y_j\int_{t=0}^{\tau}\hat{x}_{j}(t)dt + \frac{\tau }{365}{y_\text{ed}},
\end{equation}

and the GDP loss compared to the maximum is 

\begin{equation}
K_2=Y_0-Y.
\end{equation}
