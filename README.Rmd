_daedalus_ implements the integrated epidemiological and economic model in @haw2022.

## Installation

You can install the development version of daedalus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the _remotes_ package.

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("j-idea/daedalus", upgrade = FALSE)
```

## Quick start

The model can be run for any country or territory in the `country_names` list by passing the country name to the function.
This automatically pulls country-specific demographic and economic data, which is included in the package, into the model (see the ['Get started' vignette](https://jameel-institute.github.io/daedalus/articles/daedalus.html) for more details).

```{r libraries}
library(daedalus)

# run model for Canada
data <- daedalus(country("Canada"), infection("influenza_1918"))

head(data)
```

Users can select infection parameters from among seven epidemics caused by directly-transmitted viral respiratory pathogens, which are stored in the package as `daedalus::infection_data`, with epidemic identifiers are stored as `daedalus::epidemic_names`.

Users can override default country contact data and epidemic-specific infection arguments by passing named lists of parameters to `daedalus()`; see the function documentation for more details.

Users can also model the implementation of pandemic response measures: for more on this see the documentation for the main model function `daedalus()`, and the vignette on modelling interventions on the package website.
